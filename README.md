# Fall-Detection

 Fall detection system using computer vision techniques and mobile application development.<br>
 We employed computer vision algorithms to detect falls from video streams.<br>
 Then implemented a mobile application to notify caregivers or emergency services in case of a fall<br>
 Also we connected the mobile app with the model when a fall is detected using Firebase Cloud Messaging
